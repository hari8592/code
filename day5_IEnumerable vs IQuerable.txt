day5_IEnumerable vs IQuerable

diff major  - filter logic execution


IEumerable

IQueyable 

Whatever IEumerable can do ,IQuerable will also do

IEnumerable<Department> oDept= db.Departments;
            IEnumerable<Department> filterDept = oDept.Where(a => a.DepartmentId == 2).ToList<Department>();


query using profiler that we get

SELECT 
    [Extent1].[DepartmentId] AS [DepartmentId], 
    [Extent1].[DepartmentName] AS [DepartmentName]
    FROM [dbo].[Department] AS [Extent1]

above  query wiill get ALL records from DB
then at client side filter i.e your  Where will get applied 


Strange to from c# code we are adding where clause 
but where is not seen in above query






Now lets use IQuerable


  //IQueryable
            IQueryable<Department> oDept= db.Departments;
            IEnumerable<Department> filterDept = oDept.Where(a => a.DepartmentId == 2).ToList<Department>();



	SELECT 
    [Extent1].[DepartmentId] AS [DepartmentId], 
    [Extent1].[DepartmentName] AS [DepartmentName]
    FROM [dbo].[Department] AS [Extent1]
    WHERE 2 = [Extent1].[DepartmentId]



//here we are getting records with filteration



//when to use what

IQueryable -get list of students,employess  ( DB specific)   
IEnumerable - In Memeory Collections
